CircleMUD - World Files

   Contained in this lovely archive is the present shape of the world
for Circle.  Everything should be in the form of ASCII flags for easy
addition and removal of flags.  All of the shop files are in the
CircleMUD style (and they make good examples since there is a bit of
everything, from wandering shops through to shops that dislike certain
alignments or classes).

   Feedback on the world is more than welcome.  This includes
listing things that people like and things that people do not
like.  Why do you like it or dislike it?

   The zone files have been formatted into a consistent format
with comments and ordering.  This allows readers of the files to
have a much quicker grasp of what is going on in the file.  All
of the world files have been indented with three (3) characters
to begin all paragraphs.  This makes the overall format of the
world much more similar.

   If you are comparing the world to the CircleMUD 2.x world, you
will notice that some areas have been removed, others have been
added, and some have been shifted about a little bit.

   Also, please note the 'zone.lst' file in this directory, which
shows all of the zone numbers that are currently in use, and what
is using them.  Finally, full credit should be in all of the zone
files (please leave it there in case you ever release your mud code
and world), and can also be found in 'info.hlp' under 'AREAS ZONES'
which gives a current list of zones used in CircleMUD.  Please ensure
that all credits in there remain, and if you add new areas, please
credit them properly.
